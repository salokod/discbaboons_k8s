  currentRound: null,
  rounds: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  createRound: () => {},
  updateRound: () => {},
  deleteRound: () => {},
});

## Implementation Guidelines

### TDD Methodology
- Write failing tests first for each component
- Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor for performance and maintainability
- Maintain 100% test coverage throughout

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load round details to minimize initial load time
- Cache frequently accessed data (courses, friends)
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- Implement efficient pagination for large datasets

### Accessibility Standards
- Full VoiceOver/TalkBack support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Touch target size compliance (minimum 44pt)
- Screen reader optimized navigation flow

### Security Implementation
- Input validation on all user data
- Secure bet transaction handling
- Privacy controls for round visibility
- Audit trails for betting activities

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and props handling
- Business logic functions (scoring, skins, betting)
- API service layer functionality
- Utility functions and calculations

### Integration Tests
- Complete user workflows (create round → add scores → resolve bets)
- API integration with error handling
- Cross-component data flow
- Navigation patterns

### E2E Tests
- Critical user journeys
- Payment flow validation
- Multi-user round scenarios
- Performance benchmarking

## Deployment Strategy

### Feature Flags
Implement feature flags for gradual rollout:
- `ENABLE_SKINS_GAMES`
- `ENABLE_SIDE_BETTING`
- `ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_MODE`

### Progressive Rollout
