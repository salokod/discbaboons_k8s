# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the documentation cleanup performed after simplifying the rebuild script and removing production deployment capability from local development workflow.

## Changes Made

### Script Changes (Already Completed)
- ✅ Modified `rebuild-apps.sh` to hardcode `ENVIRONMENT="dev"` 
- ✅ Removed command line parameter parsing
- ✅ Replaced k-local alias with direct kubectl command
- ✅ Added cluster validation for Kind cluster
- ✅ Removed all production-specific conditional logic
- ✅ Deleted `rebuild-dev.sh` and `rebuild-prod.sh` scripts

### Documentation Updates (Completed)

#### 1. Main README.md
- ✅ Updated Quick Start section to show only development deployment
- ✅ Removed production environment testing section
- ✅ Updated project structure to reflect deleted scripts
- ✅ Added note about production deployments via CI/CD
- ✅ Added "Recent Changes" section explaining workflow simplification

#### 2. README-original.md

- ✅ Updated project structure section
- ✅ Updated deployment automation references
- ✅ Removed references to deleted scripts

#### 3. docs/README-original.md
- ✅ Updated Quick Start section
- ✅ Updated project structure section
- ✅ Updated deployment automation references

#### 4. docs/multi-environment-setup.md
- ✅ Updated deployment scripts section to reflect single script approach
- ✅ Clarified that production deployment is via CI/CD
- ✅ Updated usage examples
- ✅ Enhanced folder structure documentation
- ✅ Clarified deployment methods for each environment

#### 5. docs/development-workflows.md
- ✅ Updated multi-environment development strategy section
- ✅ Removed references to deleted scripts throughout
- ✅ Updated environment validation section
- ✅ Simplified production deployment workflow
- ✅ Updated all script references to use `rebuild-apps.sh`

## Current State

### Local Development
- **Script**: `./rebuild-apps.sh` (development environment only)
- **Target**: Kind cluster (`kind-discbaboons-learning`)
- **Environment**: Hardcoded to `dev`
- **Features**: Single replica, debug logging, development-optimized resources

### Production Deployment
- **Method**: CI/CD pipeline to DigitalOcean Kubernetes
- **Trigger**: Merge to main branch
- **Features**: Multiple replicas, RBAC, network policies, HTTPS, sealed secrets

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Simplified Development Workflow**: Single script, no parameter confusion
2. **Enhanced Security**: No local production secrets or configurations
3. **Clear Separation**: Development local, production cloud-managed
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer scripts to maintain and document
5. **Improved Safety**: No accidental production deployments from local machine

## Files Still Using Production Manifests
- CI/CD pipeline uses `manifests/prod/` for DigitalOcean deployments
- Production manifests remain for automated deployment pipeline
- Local development only uses `manifests/dev/` folder

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify development deployment works
./rebuild-apps.sh

# Check environment is development
kubectl exec deployment/express-deployment -- env | grep NODE_ENV
# Should show: NODE_ENV=development

# Check single replica
kubectl get pods -l app=express
# Should show 1 pod running
```
