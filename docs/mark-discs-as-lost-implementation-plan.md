# Mark Disc(s) as Lost - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**Problem:** Users can view lost discs and recover them, but cannot initially mark discs as lost through the mobile app interface.

**Solution:** Add UI components to complete the disc lifecycle: Mark Lost → View Lost → Recover

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full implementation with modern UI and optimistic updates.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What Exists
- **Backend APIs:** `PATCH /discs/:id/lost` and `PATCH /discs/bulk-mark-lost`
- **Service Methods:** `markDiscAsLost()` and `bulkMarkDiscsAsLost()` in `bagService.js`
- **Lost Disc Viewing:** `LostDiscsScreen` with orange theming and search
- **Recovery Flow:** `RecoverDiscModal` with bag selection
- **Multi-select Infrastructure:** `BulkActionBar` and selection system

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**
- ✅ **UI to mark single disc as lost** - SwipeableDiscRow integration with MarkAsLostModal
- ✅ **UI to mark multiple discs as lost** - BulkActionBar enhancement  
- ✅ **Integration with existing swipe actions** - "Mark Lost" swipe action added
- ✅ **Modern card-based bag selection** - Enhanced RecoverDiscModal UI
- ✅ **Optimistic disc count updates** - Immediate count updates without refresh
- ✅ **Professional visual design** - Orange theming and modern animations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Single Disc Functionality

#### 1.1 Create `MarkAsLostModal` Component
**Location:** `/apps/mobile-app/src/components/modals/MarkAsLostModal.js`

**Features:**
- Display selected disc information
- Optional notes input (500 character limit)
- Warning about disc removal from bag
- Loading states and error handling
- Orange theme (#FF9500) for consistency

**Props Interface:**
```javascript
{
  visible: boolean,
  onClose: function,
  onSuccess: function,
  discs: Array<disc>,
  mode: 'single' | 'bulk'
}
```

#### 1.2 Add Swipe Action Integration
**Location:** `/apps/mobile-app/src/components/bags/SwipeableDiscRow.js`

**Implementation:**
- Add "Mark Lost" to right swipe actions
- Position between "Edit" and "Delete"
- Orange color theme with `warning-outline` icon
- Trigger `MarkAsLostModal` on tap

#### 1.3 API Integration
**Service Calls:**
- Single disc: `markDiscAsLost(contentId, notes)`
- Handle success/error states
- Refresh bag contents after marking
- Show success feedback

### Phase 2: Bulk Operations

#### 2.1 Enhance `BulkActionBar`
**Location:** `/apps/mobile-app/src/components/bags/BulkActionBar.js`

**Changes:**
- Add "Mark Lost" button alongside existing "Move" button
- Two-button horizontal layout
- Orange theme for "Mark Lost" vs blue theme for "Move"
- Disable when no discs selected

#### 2.2 Multi-Select Integration
**Location:** `/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/bags/BagDetailScreen.js`

**Flow:**
1. Long press disc → Enter multi-select mode
2. Select multiple discs
3. Tap "Mark Lost" in `BulkActionBar`
4. Open `MarkAsLostModal` with selected discs
5. Confirm action → API call → Refresh bag

#### 2.3 Bulk Modal Support
**Enhancement to `MarkAsLostModal`:**
- Support bulk mode with multiple disc preview
- Show count: "Mark X Discs as Lost"
- Display disc names/details
- Single notes field for all selected discs

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```
BagDetailScreen
├── SwipeableDiscRow (enhanced with "Mark Lost" action)
├── BulkActionBar (enhanced with "Mark Lost" button)
└── MarkAsLostModal (new component)
```

### State Management
- Use existing `BagRefreshContext` for updates
- Leverage `useMultiSelect` hook for bulk operations
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns

### API Endpoints (Ready to Use)
```javascript
// Single disc
PATCH /api/bags/discs/:contentId/lost
Body: { is_lost: true, lost_notes: "optional note" }

// Bulk operation  
PATCH /api/bags/discs/bulk-mark-lost
Body: { content_ids: [...], lost_notes: "optional note" }
```

### Service Methods (Ready to Use)
```javascript
// From bagService.js
markDiscAsLost(contentId, notes)
bulkMarkDiscsAsLost(contentIds, notes)
```

## Design System Integration

### Visual Consistency
- **Orange Theme:** #FF9500 (matches `LostDiscsScreen`)
- **Icons:** `warning-outline` for lost disc actions
- **Modal Pattern:** Follow `RecoverDiscModal` structure
- **Button Styles:** Use existing `Button` component patterns

### User Experience
- **Swipe Actions:** Consistent with edit/move/delete patterns
- **Multi-select:** Leverage existing selection infrastructure  
- **Confirmations:** Follow app-wide confirmation dialog patterns
- **Navigation:** Post-action navigation to lost discs screen

## TDD Implementation Approach

### Slice 1: Modal Foundation
- Test: Component exports and renders
- Test: Display disc information correctly
- Implementation: Basic modal structure

### Slice 2: Form Controls
- Test: Notes input with character limit
- Test: Form validation
- Implementation: TextInput integration

### Slice 3: API Integration
- Test: Single disc API calls
- Test: Error handling
- Implementation: Service method integration

### Slice 4: Swipe Action
- Test: Action appears in swipe menu
- Test: Modal opens on action
- Implementation: SwipeableDiscRow enhancement

### Slice 5: Bulk Operations
- Test: Bulk action button appears
- Test: Multiple disc selection
- Implementation: BulkActionBar enhancement

### Slice 6: Success Handling
- Test: Bag refresh after action
- Test: Success feedback
- Implementation: State updates and navigation
