## Business Rules

### Side Bet Creation
- **Participant Only**: Only round participants can create side bets
- **Required Participants**: `participants` array is required - specify all players who will be in the bet
- **Creator Inclusion**: Creator should be included in the `participants` array (not added automatically)
- **Atomic Creation**: Bet and all participants are added in a single database transaction
- **Multiple Bets**: Multiple bets of the same type are allowed
- **Bet Types**: Must be either "hole" (resolved during/after specific hole) or "round" (resolved at end of round)
- **Hole Validation**: "hole" bets require holeNumber, "round" bets must not include holeNumber

### Bet Participation
- **Creation-Time Only**: All participants must be specified when creating the bet
- **Participant Validation**: All participant UUIDs must be valid round_players.id values
- **No Joining After Creation**: Players cannot join bets after creation (no separate join endpoint)
- **Editing Participants**: Participant list can be modified via PUT endpoint (future feature)
- **Persistent**: Bets persist even if player is removed from round

### Financial Tracking
- **Pot Calculation**: Total pot = amount Ã— number of participants
- **Winner Declaration**: Anyone can declare/change winners
- **No Pot Splitting**: Single winner takes entire pot
- **Cancellation**: Anyone can cancel bets

## Implementation Notes

- Bet creator is automatically determined from authenticated user
- **Participants Logic**: `participants` array is required and all specified players are added to the bet
- **Atomic Operations**: Bet creation and participant additions happen in a single database transaction
- **Validation**: All participant UUIDs validated against round_players table before bet creation
- **Error Handling**: If any participant is invalid, entire operation is rolled back
- All monetary amounts stored as DECIMAL(10,2) for precision
- Bet types are restricted to "hole" or "round" with corresponding validation rules
- Hole numbers validated against reasonable range (1-50) but not against specific course
- Created timestamp set to current time

## Getting Player UUIDs

To use the `participants` array, you need the round_players.id UUIDs (not user.id). Get these from:
- `GET /api/rounds/:id/players` - Returns all players with their round_players.id values
- `GET /api/rounds/:id` - Includes players array in the round details response

**Important**: Use `round_players.id` (the UUID), not `user_id` (the integer) in the participants array.
