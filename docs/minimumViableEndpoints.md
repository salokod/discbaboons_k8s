# Minimum Viable Endpoints for v1 Frontend Launch

## üéØ Priority Endpoints to Implement Before Frontend

Based on comprehensive analysis of existing endpoints and user experience requirements, these three endpoints should be implemented before starting frontend development:

### 1. ‚úÖ Side Bet Cancellation Endpoint - COMPLETED
**Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/rounds/:id/side-bets/:betId`  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Completion Date**: January 2025

#### ‚úÖ Completed Features:
- ‚úÖ Any participant can cancel a bet (authorization implemented)
- ‚úÖ Sets `cancelled_at` timestamp and `cancelled_by_id` in database
- ‚úÖ Returns `{ success: true }` on successful cancellation
- ‚úÖ Full validation (UUID format, user authorization, bet existence)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (unit, controller, route, integration tests)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting implemented (`roundsSideBetsRateLimit` + `roundsRequestLimit`)

#### Implementation Details:
- Service: `sideBets.cancel.service.js` with full validation and authorization
- Controller: `sideBets.cancel.controller.js` following existing patterns
- Route: `DELETE /api/rounds/:id/side-bets/:betId` with authentication middleware
- Tests: 19 total tests across all layers (service, controller, route, integration)
- Database: Uses existing `cancelled_at` and `cancelled_by_id` fields from V24 migration

---

### 2. Round Completion Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/rounds/:id/complete` or update existing `PUT /api/rounds/:id` to accept `status: "completed"`  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  
**Rationale**: Rounds currently stay "in_progress" forever with no way to mark them complete

#### Requirements:
- Only allow completion if all players have scores for all holes
- Validate that round is currently "in_progress"
- Set `status` to "completed" and update `updated_at`
- Trigger final calculations for skins and side bets
- Return comprehensive round summary with final standings

#### Implementation Notes:
- Consider using existing `PUT /api/rounds/:id` endpoint with status validation
- Add business logic to check score completion
- Could auto-suggest bet winners based on bet categories

### 3. GPS Course Search Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/courses?latitude=X&longitude=Y&radius=10`  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours  
**Rationale**: Essential for mobile "find nearby courses" functionality

#### Requirements:
- Add `latitude`, `longitude`, and `radius` query parameters
- Radius in miles (default: 10, max: 50)
- Use PostgreSQL geographic functions for distance calculation
- Return courses ordered by distance (closest first)
- Include distance in response for each course

#### Implementation Notes:
- Database already has indexes on latitude/longitude (idx_courses_location)
- Use Haversine formula or PostGIS for distance calculations
- Update `courses.search.service.js` to handle location-based queries
- Combine with existing filters (can search by location AND name/city)

## üìã Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed (1/3)
1. **Side Bet Cancellation** - ‚úÖ DONE (January 2025)

## üöÄ Ready for Frontend

Once the three priority endpoints are implemented, the backend will have:
- Complete user authentication and profiles
- Full course database with search
- Comprehensive round management
- Real-time scoring with leaderboard
- Dual betting systems (skins + side bets)
- All necessary CRUD operations

This provides a solid foundation for building an engaging v1 frontend experience.
