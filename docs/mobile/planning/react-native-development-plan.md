# React Native Development Plan

## Overview
Transitioning from backend-only development to full-stack with React Native mobile app. Goal is to learn bare React Native (without Expo) while building a mobile companion to the existing Express.js backend.

## Teaching Philosophy
- **Learn by Building**: Create something working at each step
- **Understand the Why**: Explain what each piece does and why
- **Build Confidence**: Start simple, add complexity gradually  
- **Real Connection**: Connect to actual API from day one
- **TDD Approach**: Follow existing project patterns with test-first development

## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
```
discbaboons_k8s/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ express-server/     # Existing backend (Node 22)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mobile-app/         # New React Native app (bare)
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/              # Shared code (types, utils)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/mobile/           # Mobile-specific documentation
â””â”€â”€ package.json           # Root workspace configuration
```

### Technology Choices
- **React Native**: Bare (no Expo) for learning native bridge concepts
- **Node Version**: 22 (consistent with backend via .nvmrc)
- **Package Management**: npm workspaces for monorepo
- **State Management**: TBD (likely Redux Toolkit or Zustand)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **API Integration**: Fetch with existing auth patterns

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
- [x] Set up monorepo workspace configuration
- [x] Configure npm workspaces with shared scripts
- [x] Align Node.js version requirements (22+)
- [x] Create development documentation

### Phase 2: React Native Setup âœ…
- [x] Initialize bare React Native app with iOS/Android folders
- [x] Understand React Native architecture and native bridge  
- [x] Convert from TypeScript to JavaScript for cleaner learning
- [x] Set up development environment (iOS/Android)

### Phase 2.5: TDD Hello World Tutorial (In Progress)
- [ ] Phase 1: TDD Hello World Component (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- [ ] Phase 2: TDD Styling with visual testing
- [ ] Phase 3: TDD User Interaction with state management
- [ ] Phase 4: TDD Component Composition with props
- [ ] Phase 5: Integration testing and simulator run

### Phase 3: Core Navigation & Auth
- [ ] Set up React Navigation
- [ ] Create login screen with form handling
- [ ] Connect to backend API authentication
- [ ] Implement token storage and management
- [ ] Add error handling patterns

### Phase 4: First Real Feature
- [ ] Build bags list screen (matching backend endpoint)
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh and loading states
- [ ] Add navigation between screens
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add state management (Redux/Zustand)
- [ ] Implement offline support
- [ ] Add push notifications
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Key Learning Objectives

### Understanding React Native
1. **Native Bridge**: How JavaScript communicates with iOS/Android
2. **Metro Bundler**: React Native's build system
3. **Platform Differences**: iOS vs Android development patterns
4. **Native Modules**: When and how to use platform-specific code

### Development Workflow
1. **Hot Reload**: Fast iteration during development
2. **Debugging**: React Native debugging tools and techniques
3. **Testing**: Unit and integration testing patterns
4. **Build Process**: Creating production iOS/Android builds

### Integration Patterns
1. **API Communication**: Connecting to Express.js backend
2. **Authentication**: Token-based auth flow
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across platforms
4. **State Management**: Sharing state between screens

## Progress Tracking

### Completed âœ…
- Monorepo workspace setup with npm workspaces
- Root package.json configuration with shared scripts
- Node.js version alignment (22+) via .nvmrc
- Documentation structure in docs/mobile/

### Current Focus ðŸŽ¯
- Initializing bare React Native application
- Understanding iOS/Android folder structure
- Setting up development environment

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Check iOS (Xcode) and Android Studio installation
2. Initialize React Native app in apps/mobile-app/
3. Explore generated iOS/Android native folders
4. Create first Hello World component

## Development Environment Requirements

### Required Tools
- [ ] Node.js 22+ (via .nvmrc)
- [ ] npm 9+
- [ ] React Native CLI
- [ ] Xcode (for iOS development)
- [ ] Android Studio (for Android development)
- [ ] iOS Simulator / Android Emulator

### Platform Support
- **Primary**: iOS (if Xcode available)
- **Secondary**: Android (if Android Studio available)
- **Strategy**: Start with one platform, add second later

## API Integration Plan

### Backend Endpoints to Integrate
Based on existing Express.js API:
1. **Authentication**: POST /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/refresh
2. **Bags**: GET /bags, POST /bags, GET /bags/:id
3. **Profile**: GET /profile, PUT /profile
4. **Friends**: GET /friends, POST /friends/request
5. **Rounds**: GET /rounds, POST /rounds (future phases)

### Authentication Strategy
- Use existing JWT token-based authentication
- Store tokens securely on device
- Implement automatic token refresh
- Handle auth state across app lifecycle

## Success Metrics
1. âœ… Can run backend and mobile app simultaneously via `npm run dev`
2. ðŸŽ¯ Mobile app displays "Hello World" on device/simulator
3. ðŸ“‹ Successful login connecting to backend API
4. ðŸ“‹ Display user's bags list from real backend data
5. ðŸ“‹ Navigate between screens smoothly
6. ðŸ“‹ Handle offline scenarios gracefully
