2. Extract userId from refresh token  
3. Generate NEW short-lived access token

# ðŸŽ¯ Profile Endpoints Strategy

User Journey:
User logs in â†’ Gets JWT token
App calls GET /api/profile â†’ Returns empty/null profile (user has no data)
App detects empty profile â†’ Shows "Complete your profile!" prompts
User fills out profile â†’ App calls PUT /api/profile to save data
App periodically checks â†’ Continues prompting until profile is complete
