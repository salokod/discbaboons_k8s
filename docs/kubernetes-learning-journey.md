- Multi-environment deployment (dev/prod namespaces)
- Ingress with TLS termination
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- Production-ready database backup and recovery strategies

## Key Learnings

### ConfigMaps
- **Purpose**: Store non-sensitive configuration data separately from application code
- **Benefits**: 
  - Change configuration without rebuilding Docker images
  - Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
- **Important**: ConfigMap changes don't automatically update running pods
- **Workflow**: Edit ConfigMap → Apply changes → Restart pods to pick up new config

### Image Updates
- **Remember**: Any change to `server.js` requires rebuilding and reloading the Docker image
- **Version Management**: Always increment image tag (v1 → v2 → v3) to track changes
- **Workflow**: Edit code → Build image → Load to Kind → Update deployment

### Secrets & Security
- **Base64 Encoding**: Not encryption! Anyone can decode base64 values
- **Local Development**: Use `kubectl create secret` commands, keep secret YAML files out of git
- **Production**: Never store secrets in YAML files - use external secret management
- **Security Principle**: Secrets should be injected at runtime, not baked into images or configs
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Use different secrets for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
  - Rotate secrets regularly
  - Audit secret access
  - Use external secret stores in production (Vault, cloud providers)

### Advanced Secret Management Patterns
- **Sealed Secrets**: GitOps-friendly encrypted secrets for version control
- **Secret Rotation**: Zero-downtime credential updates using dual-user approach
- **External Secret Stores**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager
- **External Secrets Operator**: Kubernetes-native secret synchronization from external sources
- **Compliance**: Meeting enterprise security requirements with audit trails

### Init Containers & Dependency Management
- **Purpose**: Run setup tasks before main application containers start
- **Sequential Execution**: Each init container must complete successfully before the next starts
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Database readiness checking (prevents startup race conditions)
  - Database migrations
- **Production Benefits**:
  - Eliminates application startup errors due to dependency unavailability
  - Centralizes dependency checking logic outside application code

### PostgreSQL Production Deployment
- **Image Selection**: PostgreSQL 17-alpine for latest features with minimal attack surface
- **Persistent Storage**: Always use PersistentVolumeClaims for stateful workloads like databases
- **Health Monitoring**: Implement both liveness and readiness probes using `pg_isready`
- **Resource Management**: Set appropriate requests/limits based on workload (256Mi-512Mi memory)
- **Security**: Never store database passwords in ConfigMaps, always use Secrets

### Database Schema Design & Foreign Key Relationships
- **DBML Documentation Standards**: Professional schema documentation using Database Markup Language
- **Database Normalization Strategy**: Separation of authentication and profile concerns
- **Advanced Migration Patterns (V3→V4→V5 Evolution)**:
  - **Nullable→Populate→Constrain Pattern**: Safe production migrations avoiding downtime
  - **Cross-Table Data Migration**: Using `INSERT...SELECT` for data movement between tables
- **Enterprise Database Architecture**: Two-table normalized authentication system

## Advanced Topics Mastered

### Multi-Environment Configuration
- **Folder-based Organization**: Separate `manifests/dev/` and `manifests/prod/` directories
- **Environment-Specific Settings**: Different resource limits, replicas, and logging levels
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **Deployment Automation**: Scripts with environment validation and safety checks

### Production Deployment Patterns
- **Container Registry**: Docker Hub integration with cross-platform builds (ARM64 → AMD64)
- **Image Management**: Semantic versioning with git SHA tracking
- **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime deployments with health checks
- **Storage Classes**: DigitalOcean block storage vs local Kind storage

### Security Hardening
- **Container Security**: Non-root execution, dropped capabilities, security contexts
- **Network Policies**: Microsegmentation with explicit ingress/egress rules
- **RBAC Implementation**: Service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security audits and image scanning

### CI/CD Automation & Semantic Versioning
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit format for automation
- **Semantic Release**: Automated version management and changelog generation
- **GitHub Actions**: Cloud-native CI/CD with conditional execution
- **Version Tracking**: Complete audit trail from commit to production
- **Image Tagging**: `v1.0.0-abc1234` format with semantic version + git SHA

### Production Operations
- **Monitoring Configuration**: Comprehensive logging and health checks
- **Resource Optimization**: Appropriate CPU/memory limits for production workloads
- **Incident Response**: Production runbook with troubleshooting procedures
- **TLS/SSL Management**: Automated Let's Encrypt certificate management with cert-manager

### Database Management
- **Flyway Migrations**: Industry-standard database migration tool
- **Init Containers**: Dependency management and database readiness checking
- **Persistent Storage**: PersistentVolumeClaims for stateful workloads
- **Backup Strategies**: Production database backup and recovery procedures
